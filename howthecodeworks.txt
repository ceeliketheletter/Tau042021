'''This is a program that will combine the cropping, turning, and shifting of hst and keck images into one streamlined program requiring user imput. Input: original image. Output: individual fits files for each step of the process. This program may require the user to open DS9 seperately'''


user input:
"Name of object" #opens a directory, then use the glob function to grab all the filters in there                                                                                          
#Run a for loop in each step to cover each filter                                                                                                                                         
#Deposit output files into a seperate output directory                                                                                                                                    




1:rotate (from turnapic.py)(using header info so North us up)                                                                                                                     
'''only HST, not Keck'''


2: equalize pixelscales (from pixscale.py) #except 475                                                                                                                                        


3: crop/shift (by centroiding a universal star (with findacentroid) as a reference point, crop each image (using cropapic.py) so their dimensions align along that star)        


3.5: check (using centroids.py)(Find the distances/slopes between stars to ensure shifting was done correctly)                                                         


4: rotate horizontal (using rotatedisk.py)(so disk is horizontal)                                                                                                                


5: crop (from cropapic.py)(just including disk and nothing else)(pixels are aligned)                                                                                             


6: take cuts along the disk and plot intensity (using finalplots.py)
